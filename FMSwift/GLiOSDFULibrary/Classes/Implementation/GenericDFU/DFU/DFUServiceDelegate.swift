     Bootloader AND an Application in the Distribution Packet and the DFU target does not
     support sending all files in a single connection. First the SD and/or BL will be sent, then
     the service will disconnect, reconnect again to the (new) bootloader and send the Application.
     - parameter totalParts: total number of parts that are to be send (this is always equal to 1 or 2).
     - parameter progress: the current progress of uploading the current part in percentage (values 0-100).
     Each value will be called at most once - in case of a large file a value e.g. 3% will be called only once,
     despite that it will take more than one packet to reach 4%. In case of a small firmware file
     some values may be ommited. For example, if firmware file would be only 20 bytes you would get
     a callback 0% (called always) and then 100% when done.
