    /**
     Setting this property to true will prevent from jumping to the DFU Bootloader
     mode in case there is no DFU Version characteristic. Use it if the DFU operation can be handled by your
     device running in the application mode. If the DFU Version characteristic exists, the
     information whether to begin DFU operation, or jump to bootloader, is taken from the
     characteristic's value. The value returned equal to 0x0100 (read as: minor=1, major=0, or version 0.1)
     means that the device is in the application mode and buttonless jump to DFU Bootloader is supported.
     
     Currently, the following values of the DFU Version characteristic are supported:
     
     **No DFU Version characteristic** - one of the first implementations of DFU Service. The device
     may support only Application update (version from SDK 4.3.0), may support Soft Device, Bootloader
     and Application update but without buttonless jump to bootloader (SDK 6.0.0) or with
     buttonless jump (SDK 6.1.0).
     
     The DFU Library determines whether the device is in application mode or in DFU Bootloader mode
     by counting number of services: if no DFU Service found - device is in app mode and does not support
     buttonless jump, if the DFU Service is the only service found (except General Access and General Attribute
     services) - it assumes it is in DFU Bootloader mode and may start DFU immediately, if there is
     at least one service except DFU Service - the device is in application mode and supports buttonless
     jump. In the lase case, you want to perform DFU operation without jumping - call the setForceDfu(force:Bool)
     method with parameter equal to true.
     
     **0.1** - Device is in a mode that supports buttonless jump to the DFU Bootloader
     
     **0.5** - Device can handle DFU operation. Extended Init packet is required. Bond information is lost
     in the bootloader mode and after updating an app. Released in SDK 7.0.0.
     
     **0.6** - Bond information is kept in bootloader mode and may be kept after updating application
     (DFU Bootloader must be configured to preserve the bond information).
     
     **0.7** - The SHA-256 firmware hash is used in the Extended Init Packet instead of CRC-16.
     This feature is transparent for the DFU Service.
     
     **0.8** - The Extended Init Packet is signed using the private key. The bootloader, using the public key,
     is able to verify the content. Released in SDK 9.0.0 as experimental feature.
     Caution! The firmware type (Application, Bootloader, SoftDevice or SoftDevice+Bootloader) is not
     encrypted as it is not a part of the Extended Init Packet. A change in the protocol will be required
     to fix this issue.
     
     By default the DFU Library will try to switch the device to the DFU Bootloader mode if it finds
     more services then one (DFU Service). It assumes it is already in the bootloader mode
     if the only service found is the DFU Service. Setting the forceDfu to true (YES) will prevent from
     jumping in these both cases.
